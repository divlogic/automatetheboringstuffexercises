# automatetheboringstuffexercises

This repo is just me tracking my progress through the book "Automate the Boring Stuff". It's a beginner's book, but I figured I'd give it a shot since I already owned it from a humble bundle and I haven't worked in Python before. For that reason, I would not consider this repo as wholly representative of where I am today and what my production code would look like.
